    <!--Description-->
      <p class="description">For this on-campus publication, I communicate with my team members each week and work with them to go through pitches and release a news budget of assigned stories for each reporter. I work closely with each reporter and offer help with finding more sources, conducting interviews and creating multi-media components. After a copy-editor reads through each story once, I go through the story again and work with the reporter to resolve any last minute issues before the story is published.</p>

      <p class="description">As the employment and income reporter at Street Sense, I worked remotely and had to familiarize myself very quickly with making several phone calls and sending succinct emails to explain my requests to many D.C. government officials and organizations. Also, through reporting on the employment and income beat, I became well versed in reading and analyzing budget documents. I also learned how to upload articles into WordPress and how to work collaboratively in writing and editing pieces.</p>

      <p class="description">During my time as a reporter for this on-campus publication, I pitched two stories a week and wrote and published one of those two pitches each week. I also took all the pictures to go along with each story. I was able to attend many different events spanning over different topics, such as a vigil, but also come up with any original stories relating to what was newsworthy at the time, such as xenophobia towards Asians due to the outbreak of COVID-19.</p>

      <p class="description">I went on air bi-weekly with the “Drop the Pop” team on the campus radio station to discuss any trending topics in the world of entertainment. I was expected to think of any trending topics and write a script to read about that topic of choice on-air. There were also several open discussion segments throughout the show so I was able to work on improvising and thinking on the spot and also came up with pop-quiz questions to ask the rest of the team on-air.</p>

      <p class="description">I was assigned to work with a first grade class and supported the teacher with any additional needs such as making copies or preparing lessons for students. I worked one-on-one with certain students who needed extra help with math and reading. I also facilitated different math stations while students rotated around the room to engage in different activities to improve their addition and subtraction skills.</p>
